Branch Creation and Switching

**Create a new branch named 'feature' and switch to it:

git branch feature
git checkout feature

**Make changes in the 'feature' branch:

echo "This is a feature branch." >> hello.txt
Add and commit the changes:

git add hello.txt
git commit -m "Updated hello.txt in the feature branch"
